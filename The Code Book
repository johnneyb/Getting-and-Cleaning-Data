1.	Checking, mutating and merging the data.
============================================

    All the files were checked for 'NA' fields. None were found. The activity 
codes (1, 6) were replaced with relevant text. All the relevant column headings
were replaced with more descriptive names. The files were merged based on the following this STRICT matrix order (No of rows, No of columns) clearly stated.
    
subject_test.txt (2947, 1)  y_test.txt (2947, 1)  Y_test_02.txt (2947,562)
subject_train.txt (7352, 1) y_train.txt (7352, 1) Y_train_02.txt (7352, 562)

The output from this merge was stored in a file called 
complete_01.txt (10299, 563).

2.	Selecting relevant columns for further analysis.
===================================================
The merged file complete_01.txt was now used as input to this process. The mean and standard deviations measurements were identified and extracted from the merged file complete_01. The result is stored in the file anal_01.txt.

3.  How were the relevant columns identified? 
=============================================

    The file features.txt file was used to identify data to be extracted. The columns in the X_test.txt and X_train.txt were labelled V1 ??? V561. A more descriptive description for V1-V561 was given in this features.txt file. Any field description containing the words 'mean', Mean' or 'std' were extracted.
86 of the 561 met this match. For example, the first column in both the 
X_test.txt and X_train.txt files were labelled 'V1'. This corresponded to the first line in the features.txt file namely. '1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X'. The word 'mean' appeared and therefore this column was extracted from the respective 
files.

4.	Further analysis.
	=================
    Only one file complete_01 was used as input to this process. The mean of each
of the measurements (extracted) were calculated for each activity carried out by each subject. The result was eventually stored in the anal_01.txt file.
6 activities ware carried out by 30 subjects resulting in 180 rows. The file 
anal_01.txt is the final and only file produced from my research and is available in this repo.
    In passing, taking the mean of a group of 'means' and the mean of a group of standard deviations is statistically questionable. This is hereby noted but is not relevant to the successful completion of this coursework.
